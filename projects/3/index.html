        <p><span class="bold-text">Built with:</span> Python/Django/VSCode.</p>
        <p><span class="bold-text">Special features include:</span>
        <p><ul><li>a simple blog app with list and detail views</li>
<li>a contact app for contact forms, using django simple-recaptcha</li>
<li>testimonials app for editorial testimonials, which generates an internally-linked testimonials page (pull quotes linked to full reviews by leveraging primary keys.)</li>
<li>a short fiction/writing app, which features a number of models, including: Piece, which allows for cover-image upload and utilizes a Many-to-Many relationship with Genre model, as well as a Review model for short fiction reviews and Publisher model for markets that utilize one-to-many Foreign-Key relationships.</li>
<li>The short fiction app also includes custom views, including detailed views for all pieces, a condensed bibliographic view, and genre-sorted views for pieces only in specific fiction genres.</li>
<li>Additionally, secrets required by the project (keys, email passwords, etc, are stored in a secrets.json file, with a get_secret() function written into settings to make for easier and more secure deployment.)</li>
<li>A custom javascript + CSS theme, "Starry Dong", which features high- contrast text and larger than average fonts chosen for readability, in in an effort to increase accessibility for those with visual impairments.</li>
<li>Beautiful, full-screen parallax scrolling display with animation.</li>
<li>Fully responsive; mobile-breakpoints implemented through media queries, viewport and other relative units, and a frankly ridiculous amount of flexbox.</li>
<li>Slideout menu with flexbox header for mobile devices.</li></ul></p>
